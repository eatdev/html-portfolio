<h1>The Best Movies According to Drew</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>A Christmas Story</h3>
<p>Christmas is my favorite time of year.  And this movie is an absolute must. I don't only watch it once, I watch it many times!</p>
<h3>Halloween</h3>
<p>Halloween is my second favorite holiday! The Halloween movie franchise is my favorite set of movies to watch during the spooky season. I watch them all!</p>
<h3>Alien</h3>
<p>Outside of horror and Christmas, I do love a good sci-fi movie! This is one of my favorites. It gave me nightmares as a child.</p>
